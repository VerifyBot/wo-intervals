# 💪🏿 wo-intervals

A tool to help manage your workout time by setting a time limit for every exercise.

## 🎯 Details

[workouts.json](workouts.json) contains a mapping of workout name to exercises (`time` is in minutes) <br><br>
After every exercise (except for the last one) you get a **45s rest**.

### 🧭 Preview

<p>The tool currently looks like this:</p>

* Bottom Left: `Current time`
* Bottom Right: `ETA workout finish`

## TODO
  - [ ] Add an option to pause the workout (if you need to take care of something that cannot be delayed)
  - [ ] More sound effects on exercise finish (for the vibe)
